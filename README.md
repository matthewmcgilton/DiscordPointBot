# DiscordPointBot

This is a revamped version of the bot I refer to on my resume; I'm still reimplementing some features. I decided to remake it because the old version has become outdated and is on an old PC. 

Additionally, I am taking this as an opportunity to create a new bot with the use of better programming principles. A discord bot which rewards users with points based on the amount of messages they send in the server's chat. The users are then able to use these points in various games.
