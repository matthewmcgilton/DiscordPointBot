# DiscordPointBot by Matthew McGilton

## Summary
This is a discord bot which rewards users with points based on how active they are in the server's chat. The users are able to then use their points on games, send points to others, and check their rank on the server!

## Objective
My goal was to create this bot with the use of multiple different packages and services. I felt as though I wanted to learn how to integrate all of them together in to one single program. Additionally, I wanted to spend a lot of my time making sure that I created this bot with the use of proper programming practices.

## Difficulties and Challenges
Utilizing MongoDB took a lot of experimenting. Learning how the databases and collections worked together was something that took a lot of time testing as well as reading up on to fully figure out. Once I had that down, it was another challenge trying to determine the best way to query the database on MongoDB, especially with how the cursor objects work.

## Key Takeaways/Learning Opportunities
I learned a lot while building this bot. Not just with discord.py, pymongo, or heroku, but also with general creation of software. I spent a lot of time outside before working on the bot just looking at the best way to structure a plan when it comes to creating something new. This helped tremendously with my anxiety when it comes to building large projects. Initially, things can look daunting in the big picture, but once you break down everything in to small steps and components it's much easier to complete one thing at a time without getting discouraged.

## Tasks
### Completed:
- MongoDB support
- Heroku support
- Basic commands and account logging

### Todo:
- Games
- Additional commands (transacting/trading)
